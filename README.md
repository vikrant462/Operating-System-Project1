This Project is the solution of the following Question.

Ques. 17. Design a scheduler following non-preemptive scheduling approach to schedule the processes that arrives at different units and having some positive burst time. Scheduler selects the process with largest burst time from the queue for the execution. Process is not being preempted until it finishes its service time. Compute the average waiting time and average turnaround time. What should be the average waiting time if processes are executed according to Shortest Job First scheduling approach with the same attribute values.
